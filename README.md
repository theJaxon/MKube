### Running Vagrant on Mac M1
- Following the gist [Vagrant and VMWare Fusion 13 Player on Apple M1 Pro](https://gist.github.com/sbailliez/2305d831ebcf56094fd432a8717bed93)
- Initially the main limitation was the lack of Boxes that i was able to use, then I found [some other Vagrant boxes by gyptazy](https://app.vagrantup.com/gyptazy), currently for this project the box [gyptazy/ubuntu22.04-arm64](https://app.vagrantup.com/gyptazy/boxes/ubuntu22.04-arm64/versions/1.0.1) is being used
